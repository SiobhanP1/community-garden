            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <h2>The Seed of an Idea</h2>
            <p>Two years ago, Marie and I were gifted the use of a small plot of land. It was close to the town center
                and surrounded on all sides by buildings. We decided that we wanted to create something beautiful in
                this space. Plants are we what know so we decided on a garden. There our journey began.</p>

            <h2>How it Grew</h2>
            <p> With the help of
                some willing volunteers, we began to prepare the ground. We happily found the quality of soil quite
                good. We wanted the place to be of value to the community and asked whoever we met what they would like
                to see grow there. Word spread and the school next door asked if they might be able to grow some
                vegetables. </p>
                <br>
            <p>Our garden has come a long way since then. We host regular free workshops, provide fresh fruit and vegetables to the local homeless shelter and have come closer as a community. We look forward to growing this space even more in the future.</p>
