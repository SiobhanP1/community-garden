The purpose of the Community Garden website is to:
* develop user interest in the community garden

The website is targeted at people who want to learn how to grow fruit and vegetables, people who want to grow vegetables but do not have a garden of their own, people who want access to fresh organic fruit and vegetables, and people interested in activities through which they can get to know other people in the same community.

## Features

### Fixed Navigation Bar

The navigation bar contains a link to each page. It is fixed at the top of each page so that it is always visible and easy to find. It allows the user to easily navigate between pages, and uses color to draw the user's attention to the Call to Action ('Contact Us' button).

### Footer Containing Links to Social Media 

The footer contains links to the social media accounts connected to the website (Facebook, Instagram, Youtube). A title appears ('Follow us on Facebook') when the user's mouse hovers over one of the icons, encouraging the user to click. These links make it easy for the user to connect with and follow the Community Garden's social media accounts.

### Google Map Showing Location

The iframe map shows the location of the garden on Google. The user can interact with the map-zoom in, zoom out, find their current location-in order to make it easy to locate and visit the garden.

### Subscribe Form 

The subscribe form contains first name, last name and email input fields. Users can input this information if they want to receive news updates and information about events by email. The garden can share good information with users, keep in touch with users and publicise events.

### Article Sharing Background and 'Why'

The 'Our Story' article shares the story behind the garden, why it was started and how it has grown over time. It includes both text and photos. It allows users to read and decide whether the values of the garden align with their own and whether they would like to become part of the garden community.

### 'What We Do' Section on Home Page

The 'What we do' section shares the main activities of the garden. The user can discover whether the garden will likely host activities that interest them, that they would like to participate in, or that they would like to find out more about.

## Future Features

* An events section or page sharing event details, times, days, how to participate, etc.
* A gallery page sharing photos from recent events.

## Typography and Color Schemes 

### Typography

* Montserrat is used for headings and Merriweather for body text. 

### Color Scheme

* Green is used as the base color and background color for the navigation and footer sections, and appears in all of the images. Green was chosen due to its association with nature and gardens, fitting the theme of the website. 
* Orange is used as an accent color and for call-to-action buttons as it provides a strong contrast with green.
* All background and foreground color combinations on the website meet WCAG AA color contrast requirements. Color contrast was checked using [Web AIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Fixed Bugs

* The list items in the What We Do section appeared on top of the fixed navigation bar when they reached the top of the page instead of disappearing under it. This was fixed by adding a z-index style declaration (with high positive value) to the CSS code applied to the navigation bar.

* A white space appeared under the footer bar on the Contact and Confirmation pages when viewed at 50% in Chrome DevTools. This was fixed by increasing the size of the iframe map so that it occupied more vertical space. 

### Supported Screens and Browsers

* The website was tested on the following devices using the simulator in Chrome DevTools: Google Pixel 5, iPhone 12 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy A51, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, iPad, iPad Air.
* It has not been tested on browsers other than Chrome.
