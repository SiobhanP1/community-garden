# Community Garden
## Purpose
The purpose of the Community Garden website is to:
* develop user interest in the community garden
* encourage users to visit the community garden
* share location and opening hours information
* share various means of contacting the garden

The website is targeted at people who want to learn how to grow fruit and vegetables, people who want to grow vegetables but do not have a garden of their own, people who want access to fresh organic fruit and vegetables, and people interested in activities through which they can get to know other people in the same community.
