The website is targeted at people who want to learn how to grow fruit and vegetables, people who want to grow vegetables but do not have a garden of their own, people who want access to fresh organic fruit and vegetables, and people interested in activities through which they can get to know other people in the same community.

## Typography and Color Schemes 

### Typography

* Montserrat is used for headings and Merriweather for body text. 

### Color Scheme

* Green is used as the base color and background color for the navigation and footer sections, and appears in all of the images. Green was chosen due to its association with nature and gardens, fitting the theme of the website. 
* Orange is used as an accent color and for call-to-action buttons as it provides a strong contrast with green.
* All background and foreground color combinations on the website meet WCAG AA color contrast requirements. Color contrast was checked using [Web AIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
